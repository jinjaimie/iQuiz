INFO 449 HW7-9: iQuiz

Part 1

Basic interaction

- we need a TableView for the quizzes
- each element will lead the user to a list of questions
- so we start with the TableView filled with subjects
 - use Mathematics, Marvel Super Heroes, and Science
 - for now, use an in-memory array
 - make sure to build this as a UITableViewSource
 

TableView cells

- icon on the left (any image works)
- subject: title (30 characters)
- description: short sentence
 

ToolBar across the top

- put a button on the Toolbar, title it "Settings"
- "Settings" should (for now) pop a UIAlertController
- have it read "Settings go here"/"OK"
